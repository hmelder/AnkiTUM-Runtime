# Format


## File structure 
Each top level folder contains a single deck and is parsed into an apkg file.
These folders can contain multiple .yaml files, which are turned into subdecks.

If you want your deck to include images, create a "resource" folder in the deck folder. 
Resource folders must be named "resources" and can only contain png, jpg and jpeg files.

## deck format

A deck yaml file can have the following attributes:

id (Optional) - The id of the deck (integer). Should not be changed after initial creation. If left out, the name of the file is hashed.
title (Required) - The title of the deck (only letters, numbers, spaces and underscores allowed)
authors (Optional) - The authors of the deck (a list of strings or a string, only letters and spaces allowed)
cards (Required) - One or more cards contained in the deck

A card is created with its type like this:

```yaml
# example card
type: basic
front: "Whats 1 + 1?"
back: "It's 2"
chapter: "Basic Arithmetic"
tags:
  - super_difficult
  - addition
```

Depending on the type there may be more optional or required attributes.

## Card types

### basic

Basic cards have a front and a back.

front (Required) - The front text of the card

back (Required) - The back text of the card

tags (Optional) - A list of tags (strings)

chapter (Optional) - The lecture or chapter that the card is based on

### markdown / md_basic

Like Basic, but markdown syntax can be used to style your text or include code blocks

```
# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3

**bold**
*italic*

- list 1
- list 2
- list 3

--- seperator

```

### reverse

Reverse Cards generate two basic cards: One of them has the front and back reversed.

front (Required) - The front text of the card

back (Required) - The back text of the card

tags (Optional) - A list of tags (strings)

chapter (Optional) - The lecture or chapter that the card is based on

### cloze

Cloze types do not have a back. They contain "clozes" which are words or phrases inside a sentence 
that are blacked out and get revealed when the user turns the card around.

front (Required) - The front text of the card

tags (Optional) - A list of tags (strings)

chapter (Optional) - The lecture or chapter that the card is based on


Clozes can be defined like in the anki standard cloze type: 

```
{{c1::text to be revealed}} {{c2::More text}}
```

## Images

Images can be added with an image clause:

```
[[image: image_name.png]]
```

The corresponding file by the name of "image_name.png" must be put into the "resources" folder.
JPG and JPEG file extensions are also supported.

Please note that cloze types can't have images for now.

## Examples

Here is an example deck:

```yaml
id: 123
title: Penguins
authors: Joe
cards:
  - type: basic
    front: Whats the worlds largest penguin?
    back: The Emperor Penguin
    chapter: Penguins 101
    
  - type: cloze
    front: The {{c1::Macaroni}} Penguin has the worlds most epic hairstyle
    chapter: Penguins 101
  
  # Card in Markdown
  - type: basic
    format: markdown
    front: Which penguin species is the fastet?
    back: |+
    # **Gentoo** Penguins are the fastest of all penguin species!
    1. Here a random list
    2. With
    3. No
    4. Content
      - But what is content?
```

## Reverse Parser

This command allows you to turn anki decks into our YAML format.

Export you anki deck as a txt file. Select **"export Notes"** and tick **all** the boxes when exporting.

```
ankitum-genyaml [INPUT.txt] -o [OUTPUT FOLDER]

Optional arguments:

-a/--author [NAME]
-t/--title [DECK TITLE]
--set-ids If this flag is set, ids will be generated for the cards
--basic-type [TYPE] Set the type for basic cards. Possible options include: basic, html, latex_plus. html is the default, so all the html tags get parsed correctly
--cloze-type [TYPE] Set the type for cloze cards. Possible options include: cloze, html_cloze. html_cloze is the default, so all the html tags get parsed correctly
```

Example command:
```
ankitum-genyaml trees.txt -o ./out -a "Bob Ross" -t "Trees and how to paint them" --basic-type "latex_plus"
```
